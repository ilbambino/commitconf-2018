# Test HyperLogLog 

This is a small script to test HyperLogLog with Redis

It creates many random strings and adds them to Redis. It adds them in two places, 
one set, and a HyperLogLog. At the end it prints the cardinality of the set (real one) 
and the estimate. And the error of the estimate.

## Running it

To run it you need to have a Redis. The script uses the localhost (modify it if not) and default port.
You can easily get one with Docker:

```
docker run -p 6379:6379 redis
```

And then just `go run populate.go`  (having Go installed of course!)
As it is not using vendoring or modules you might need to do first a `go get github.com/go-redis/redis` 

That't it!

If you want to connect to Redis directly you can do it easily also with Docker (use that if you run Redis locally).

```
docker run -it goodsmileduck/redis-cli redis-cli  -h host.docker.internal
```

And once you are inside Redis you can either check the set with a `SMEMBERS commit` command. Or check the 
HyperLogLog estimate with `PFCOUNT commitHLL`
